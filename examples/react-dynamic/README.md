# React Dynamic
This example shows React being used to display a dynamic map. A dynamic map being one which do not know all of the tile
layers and maps which need to be used when creating the MultiMap instance. Instead, we create a new MultiMap and add
the new tile layers and maps when they become available. Useful for preloading an initial layer whilst waiting for
another process to complete.

If you don't need to change tile layers or maps after creation see the [react example](../react/README.md).   

## Usage

npm install
npm start
```
