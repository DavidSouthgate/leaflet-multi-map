# React
This example shows React being used to display a static map. A static map being one which we know all of the tile layers
and maps needed when we create a MultiMap instance.

If you need to change tile layers or maps after creation see the [react-dynamic example](../react-dynamic/README.md).   

## Usage

npm install
npm start
```
